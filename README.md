A Kubernetes operator that watches RSS feeds and posts new entries to Discord via webhooks. Feeds are configured declaratively with a `FeedGroup` custom resource.

> **Note:** This project is vibecoded — built quickly with heavy AI assistance. It does include specific hardening (SSRF guards on both the RSS fetch and Discord webhook paths, a response-size cap, `@everyone`/`@here` mention suppression, `javascript:`/`data:` URI stripping on embed URLs, and Discord API length clamping), but it hasn't had a third-party security review, so read the code before trusting it with anything important.

## Features

- Define RSS feeds as Kubernetes CRDs
- Post updates to Discord webhooks
- Filter entries by regex or keywords
- Customize the message format per feed group or per feed
- Render entries as native Discord embeds (colored bubble, thumbnail, author/footer) instead of plain text
- Post into forum channels, either as a new thread per entry or into an existing thread
- Override the webhook's display name/avatar per feed group
- Conditional GET (ETag / If-Modified-Since) on RSS fetches — skips re-downloading and re-parsing unchanged feeds
- Configurable check interval and retry behavior
- Prometheus metrics, an optional ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule alerts, and a Grafana dashboard for per-outcome feed processing

## Installing

Requires a Kubernetes 1.26+ cluster and a Discord webhook URL.

### Helm

```bash
helm install rss2discord-operator ./dist/chart \
  --namespace rss2discord-operator-system \
  --create-namespace
```

### kubectl

```bash
kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
```

### mise

```bash
IMG=my-registry/rss2discord-operator:v0.1.0 mise run deploy
# or
IMG=my-registry/rss2discord-operator:v0.1.0 mise run helm-deploy
```

## Usage

1. Create a secret with your Discord webhook URL:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic discord-webhook \
  -n default \
  --from-literal=url='https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_TOKEN'
```

2. Create a `FeedGroup`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rss2discord.maverickd650.dev/v1alpha1
kind: FeedGroup
metadata:
  name: tech-news
  namespace: default
spec:
  discordWebhookSecretRef:
    name: discord-webhook
    key: url
  interval: "30m"
  retries: 3
  retryInterval: "5m"
  format: |
    **{{.Title}}**
    {{.Description}}
    [Read more]({{.Link}})
  feeds:
    - rssUrl: "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"
      filter:
        keywords:
          - kubernetes
          - golang
    - rssUrl: "https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/.rss"
      paused: false
```

To render entries as embeds (with a colored bubble and thumbnail) instead of plain text, and to post each entry as a new forum thread:

```yaml
spec:
  embed:
    enabled: true
    color: "#5865F2"
    footerText: "via tech-news"
  feeds:
    - rssUrl: "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"
      forumThreadName: "{{.Title}}"
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f feedgroup.yaml
```

3. Watch it work:

```bash
kubectl logs -n rss2discord-operator-system -l control-plane=controller-manager -f
```

## Configuration reference

### FeedGroup spec

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `discordWebhookSecretRef` | `SecretKeySelector` | required | Secret containing the Discord webhook URL |
| `interval` | `string` | `30m` | How often to check feeds |
| `retries` | `int` | `3` | Retries for failed operations |
| `retryInterval` | `string` | `5m` | Delay between retries |
| `format` | `string` | see below | Discord message template (used when `embed` is not enabled) |
| `embed` | `*Embed` | optional | Default embed config for all feeds in the group |
| `username` | `string` | optional | Overrides the webhook's display name. Rejected at `kubectl apply` time (CEL validation) if it contains "clyde" or "discord", or is over 80 characters — Discord's own webhook API rejects these |
| `avatarURL` | `string` | optional | Overrides the webhook's avatar |
| `feeds` | `[]Feed` | required | RSS feeds to monitor |

### Feed

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rssUrl` | `string` | required | RSS feed URL |
| `filter` | `*Filter` | optional | Filter rules for entries |
| `format` | `string` | optional | Overrides the group's format for this feed |
| `embed` | `*Embed` | optional | Overrides the group's embed config for this feed |
| `forumThreadName` | `string` | optional | Template for a new forum post's title; set on FeedGroups whose webhook targets a forum channel |
| `forumThreadID` | `string` | optional | Posts into an existing forum thread instead of creating a new one (takes precedence over `forumThreadName`) |
| `paused` | `bool` | `false` | Stop processing this feed without removing it |

### Filter

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `regex` | `string` | Regex matched against title/description |
| `keywords` | `[]string` | Keywords matched against title/description (OR) |

### Embed

When `enabled`, a feed's messages are sent as a native Discord embed (the colored bubble UI) instead of plain text. The embed's title/link/timestamp come directly from the entry; only the description is templated.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Render messages as embeds instead of plain text |
| `color` | `string` | none | Side-bar color, as hex (`#5865F2` or `5865F2`) |
| `descriptionFormat` | `string` | `{{.Description}}` | Template for the embed description |
| `authorName` | `string` | optional | Shown on the embed's author line |
| `footerText` | `string` | optional | Shown in the embed's footer |

If the feed entry has a lead image (an RSS `<enclosure>` or Media RSS `<media:thumbnail>`/`<media:content>`, or an Atom `<link rel="enclosure">`), it's attached automatically as the embed's thumbnail.

### Message template

Default (used only when `embed.enabled` is false):

```YAML
**{{.Title}}**
{{.Description}}
[Read more]({{.Link}})
```

Available fields: `.Title`, `.Description`, `.Link`, `.Published`, `.Author`, `.Categories` (comma-separated).

### Forum channels

If `discordWebhookSecretRef` points at a webhook created for a forum channel, set `forumThreadName` on a feed to create a new forum post per entry (templated, same placeholders as `format`), or `forumThreadID` to post into one specific existing thread instead.

## Development

Tooling is managed by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) — it pins every tool version (Go, golangci-lint, controller-gen, kustomize, helm, kind, etc.) in [`.mise/config.toml`](.mise/config.toml), so local development matches CI exactly. Docker is the only host prerequisite.

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh   # one-time: install mise
mise install                 # install the pinned toolchain
mise tasks                   # list available tasks
```

```bash
mise run build       # build the manager binary
mise run test        # unit tests
mise run lint        # lint
mise run lint-fix    # lint with autofix
mise run test-e2e    # e2e tests, needs a Kind cluster
```

Releases are managed by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which reads the **header line** of each commit on `main` to decide what goes in the changelog. Squash-merging a PR uses the PR title as that header — so when bundling a real fix inside an otherwise-`chore`-typed PR (e.g. a Renovate dependency bump), give the PR a `fix:`-prefixed title, not the bot's default, or the fix silently won't be picked up.

After changing CRD types or RBAC markers:

```bash
mise run manifests   # regenerate CRDs and RBAC
mise run generate    # regenerate DeepCopy methods
```

Build and push an image:

```bash
export IMG=my-registry/rss2discord-operator:v0.1.0
mise run docker-build
mise run docker-push
```

## Project layout

```
api/v1alpha1/          FeedGroup CRD types
internal/controller/   Reconciliation logic
internal/discord/      Discord webhook client
internal/rss/          RSS feed client
config/                Kubernetes manifests (CRDs, RBAC, kustomize)
dist/                  Generated install.yaml and Helm chart

cmd/main.go            Entry point
```

## Helm chart

Located in `dist/chart/`. Key values in `dist/chart/values.yaml`:

```yaml
manager:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/maverickd650/rss2discord-operator
    # tag: ""   # defaults to the chart's appVersion
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 128Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 64Mi
```

Resource names drop the redundant `-controller-manager` suffix — with a release named `rss2discord-operator`, the Deployment, ServiceAccount, and Service are all named `rss2discord-operator` (selection still happens on the `control-plane: controller-manager` label). The `kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml` path keeps the longer `rss2discord-operator-controller-manager` names, so prefer the label selector in commands that target the pod.

Common commands:

```bash
helm status rss2discord-operator -n rss2discord-operator-system
helm history rss2discord-operator -n rss2discord-operator-system
helm rollback rss2discord-operator -n rss2discord-operator-system
helm uninstall rss2discord-operator -n rss2discord-operator-system
```

## Observability

The controller exports these Prometheus metrics, all labeled by `namespace` and `name` (the FeedGroup):

| Metric | Type | Extra labels | What it tells you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rss2discord_feed_operations_total` | counter | `rss_url`, `outcome` (`sent`, `fetch_error`, `send_error`, `render_error`, `rate_limited`) | Send-success ratios and a per-feed error breakdown (which feed in the group, and why) |
| `rss2discord_feed_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `operation` (`fetch`, `send`) | Latency of the operator's outbound RSS fetches and Discord sends (e.g. a feed host hanging up to its timeout) |
| `rss2discord_feedgroup_reconcile_duration_seconds` | histogram | — | Wall-clock time of a full reconcile (every feed's fetch and send), so a FeedGroup creeping toward its requeue interval shows up before it starts missing it |
| `rss2discord_message_overflow_chars` | histogram | — | Characters trimmed from a rendered Discord message before it was clamped to fit Discord's length limits; only recorded on actual overflow, so `histogram_count(rate(rss2discord_message_overflow_chars[5m]))` answers "how often does this FeedGroup's content get cut off" |
| `rss2discord_feed_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | — | Unix time of the last successful check of this FeedGroup's feeds (a 304 or a fetch with nothing new still counts); alert on staleness with `time() - rss2discord_feed_last_success_timestamp_seconds > <window>` |

Series for a FeedGroup are removed from the registry when that FeedGroup is deleted, so a removed group can't leave a stale freshness reading behind.

All three histograms (`rss2discord_feed_request_duration_seconds`, `rss2discord_feedgroup_reconcile_duration_seconds`, `rss2discord_message_overflow_chars`) are exposed as **native-only** histograms -- no classic `le` buckets, just the native exponential representation (`NativeHistogramBucketFactor` set, `Buckets` left unset in [metrics.go](internal/controller/metrics.go)). This keeps the bundled dashboard from carrying duplicate classic + native panels for the same data, but it means there's no `_bucket` fallback: if the scrape doesn't carry the native representation, these three metrics expose only `_count`/`_sum` with no `histogram_quantile` support at all.

To actually get resolution out of these metrics:

- **`prometheus.scrapeNativeHistograms` must stay `true`** (the chart default, requires `prometheus.enabled`). It has the `ServiceMonitor` set `scrapeProtocols`/`scrapeClassicHistograms`/`scrapeNativeHistograms` on the `ServiceMonitor`'s `spec` (top-level `ServiceMonitorSpec` fields, not per-endpoint) so Prometheus negotiates protobuf and pulls the native representation. Setting it `false` doesn't fall back to classic buckets for these metrics -- there are none -- it just stops scraping resolution for them.
- **Prometheus must support it too.** Native histograms require Prometheus >= v2.45, and are only stable (no feature flag needed) since v3.8; on v2.45–v3.7 you also need to start Prometheus with `--enable-feature=native-histograms`.
- **Query it directly by metric name** — there's no `_bucket` suffix or `le` label to sum over. `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(rss2discord_feed_request_duration_seconds[5m]))` against the bare metric name gives you the p95.
- **Grafana needs a recent-enough version** (>= v9.4, ideally >= v11 for heatmap support) with the Prometheus data source's native histogram support enabled to render the dashboard's "Performance" row; older Grafana will show those panels empty rather than erroring.

The metrics endpoint is enabled by default (`metrics.enabled`, served on `:8443`). The remaining pieces are opt-in via chart values and each requires the relevant operator to be installed in the cluster:

| Value | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prometheus.enabled` | `false` | Installs a `ServiceMonitor` so prometheus-operator scrapes the metrics endpoint |
| `prometheus.scrapeNativeHistograms` | `true` | With `prometheus.enabled`, has the `ServiceMonitor` negotiate protobuf so Prometheus actually gets resolution out of the operator's native-only histograms (`feed_request_duration_seconds`, `feedgroup_reconcile_duration_seconds`, `message_overflow_chars`); without it these three metrics expose `_count`/`_sum` only |
| `prometheusRule.enabled` | `false` | Installs a `PrometheusRule` alerting on sustained `fetch_error` / `send_error` / `rate_limited` per feed (annotations name the failing feed URL and, for fetch/send errors, the failure reason). Tune with `prometheusRule.rateInterval`, `.for`, and `.severity` |
| `grafanaDashboard.enabled` | `false` | Ships a ConfigMap holding the dashboard JSON plus a `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource for the [grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator) (referencing it via `configMapRef`), with rows for executive summary (success rate, failing/stale feed counts), service health, action-required triage (failing FeedGroups, top erroring feeds), feed freshness, performance (fetch/send latency p50/p95/p99 + heatmap, reconcile duration, message overflow size -- all native histogram panels), and operator (controller-runtime/workqueue) health. Target a specific Grafana instance with `grafanaDashboard.instanceSelector`; the dashboard's `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` placeholder is resolved to a real datasource via `grafanaDashboard.datasources` |

```bash
helm install rss2discord-operator ./dist/chart \
  --namespace rss2discord-operator-system --create-namespace \
  --set prometheus.enabled=true \
  --set prometheusRule.enabled=true \
  --set grafanaDashboard.enabled=true
```

`grafanaDashboard.enabled=true` on its own assumes:

- the [grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator) is installed in the cluster (its `GrafanaDashboard` CRD must exist), and
- it manages a `Grafana` CR with a datasource named `prometheus` in it.

If either isn't true, override these on install:

```bash
helm install rss2discord-operator ./dist/chart \
  --namespace rss2discord-operator-system --create-namespace \
  --set grafanaDashboard.enabled=true \
  --set grafanaDashboard.instanceSelector.matchLabels.dashboards=grafana \
  --set 'grafanaDashboard.datasources[0].inputName=DS_PROMETHEUS' \
  --set 'grafanaDashboard.datasources[0].datasourceName=my-prometheus-datasource-name'
```

- `grafanaDashboard.instanceSelector` must match the labels on the `Grafana` CR(s) you want this dashboard synced into — left empty (the default), it matches every `Grafana` CR the operator manages, which is fine with a single instance.
- `grafanaDashboard.datasources` resolves the dashboard's `${DS_PROMETHEUS}` placeholder to a real datasource: the operator does a literal text substitution of `${inputName}` → `datasourceName` in the dashboard JSON before pushing it to Grafana, so `datasourceName` must be the **name** of an existing datasource in your Grafana instance, not its UID.
- If your `Grafana` CR lives in a different namespace than this release, `grafanaDashboard.allowCrossNamespaceImport` (default `true`) is what lets the operator's `GrafanaDashboard` controller, running wherever it runs, pick up the `ConfigMap`/CR pair from this release's namespace.

The dashboard JSON lives at [`dist/chart/dashboards/feedgroup-overview.json`](dist/chart/dashboards/feedgroup-overview.json) if you'd rather import it manually.

## Troubleshooting

Check logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n rss2discord-operator-system -l control-plane=controller-manager -f
```

Check FeedGroup status:

```bash
kubectl describe feedgroup my-feedgroup -n default
kubectl get feedgroup my-feedgroup -n default -o yaml
```

Common issues:

- `LastError: webhook - discord webhook URL is empty` — the secret or key in `discordWebhookSecretRef` is wrong.
- FeedGroup not updating — check `interval` and the operator logs.
- Messages formatted wrong — check template placeholders against `.Title`, `.Description`, `.Link`, `.Published`.
